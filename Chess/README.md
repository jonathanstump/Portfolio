The Pieces: <br/>
<p align="left">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each piece inherits from a 'Piece.java' abstract class, which outlines common features and methods that will need to be tracked
for each piece, such as color, name, if piece is captured, if piece can move to a particular square, and if piece is the same color as another piece. Then, 
each piece has its own class that extends the abstract class and overrides the canMove method according to the logic of each piece. Some pieces also have 
additional methods to keep track of their unique properties, such as the pawn being able to move two spaces on its first move and the king not being able
to move into check.
